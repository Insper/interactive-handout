# Welcome to Interactive Handout

*Interactive handouts* is a tool to create online materials for courses. It's based on [mkdocs](https://mkdocs.org) and [mkdos-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for authoring and [github](https://github.com) for publishing. 

Besides publishing materials, *Interactive Handouts* also allows the  addition of some interactive contents that enhance the students' learning. Our [Getting Started](getting-started/) section contains all you need to start creating awesome course materials.

Right now the following interactive contents are implemented:

- Single choice quizzes
- One line text answers
- Adding reference slides to a handout
- Progress check button
